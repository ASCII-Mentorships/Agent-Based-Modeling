Agent based modeling (ABM) is a bottom-up simulation technique where we analyze a system by its individual agents that interact with each other. In this project, we will learn how to simulate different environments using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) whcih was developed at Northwestern's Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL).
